# Gender-Indentification-through-Image
This Programme tells whether the person in the photo in male or female based on whether the image is closer to mean male or female images. I'm sorry for those who believe in non-binary genders.
The code given uses 20 images of males and females. Images are reshaped to a certain size and then mean of each pixel value in saved to obtain the centroid of both datasets.
Then a input photo is given and compared to male and female averages.

This works great if only one person is there in the image, but this is not trusted method for indentifying gender of person in image as accuracy rate int the training set itself is around 88%.

# THIS DOESN'T WORK!!! WHY DID I DO THIS ???
Free Time...

Peace!!
